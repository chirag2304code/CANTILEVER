### The challenge
- Build out the project to the designs provided
- Implementing cart functionality 
- Connecting to Sanity as back end database for e-commerce
- Connecting Stripe APIs to power online payment processing for e-commerce

### Links
The live site is deployed in vercel, but it seems that vercel can't render swiper js. In the meantime i'm still trying to find a solution

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Next JS](https://nextjs.org/) - React Framework for Production
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) - Sanity is a customizable solution that treats content as data to power digital business.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-gb-us) - APIs to power online payment processing for e-commerce
- [react-hot-toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) - react library that adds beautiful notifications to our react application. 
- [react icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - JS library to add icons
- [swiper js](https://swiperjs.com/) - JS library to add slider component
- [canvas-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti) - Lightweight JS plugin to create a confetti celebration explosion effect. It draws confetti graphics on the HTML canvas element. 

### What I learned
I learned a simple css styling to put text in a background as shown below
```js
.newsletter-background {
  font-weight: 800;
  font-size: 7.5rem;
  line-height: 151px;
  color: #f2f3f7;
  position: absolute;
  z-index: -1;
}
```
By setting position to absolute and z-index to -1 (or lower than any other z-index of other elements).
z-index is a CSS property that defines the order of overlapping HTML elements. Elements with a higher index will be placed on top of elements with a lower index

I also learned how to connect stripe as payment gate for e-commerce. Full code for connecting to stripe in /pages/api/stripe.js

The confetti effect is implemented on the payment success page after the user successfully checkouts their cart

### Continued development
The development of this project can be continued by adding a search filter functionality, an e-commerce newsletter, activate the slider function for product section in homepage. In the near future, I'm going to explore react js search filters and maybe add that functionality myself.
